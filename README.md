---

Reactive extensions for websockets.

A lightweight abstraction layer over [Starscream](https://github.com/daltoniam/Starscream) to make it reactive.

## Installation

RxWebSocket is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install it, simply add the
following line to your depedencies file:

#### Cocoapods

```ruby
pod "RxWebSocket"
```

#### Carthage

```ruby
github "fjcaetano/RxWebSocket"
```

## Usage

Every websocket event will be sent to the `stream` which is an `Observable<StreamEvent>`.

```swift
  public enum StreamEvent {
    case connect
    case disconnect(Error?)
    case pong
    case text(String)
    case data(Data)
  }
```

You may receive and send text events by subscribing to the `text` property:

```swift
let label = UILabel()
socket.rx.text
    .bind(to: label.rx.text)


sendButton.rx.tap
    .flatMap { textField.text ?? "" }
    .bind(to: socket.rx.text)
```

For further details, check the Example project.

## Contributing

After cloning the project, pull all submodules with

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Requirements

RxWebSocket relies on the following for development:

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane)
- [Python Websockets](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets)
- [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)

To install all dependencies without hassles just run:

```sh
./install_dependencies.sh
```

Which will install all the dependencies and virtual envs if necessary.

### Running Tests

Xcode and Fastlane will take care of starting and stopping websocket echoservers
for testing, however if you find that tests are timing out, this is usually a
sign that the server is not running. If so, you can manage it running

```sh
./server.sh {start|stop|restart|status}
```

This will tell wstests to launch an echo server on 127.0.0.1:9000. If this port
is unusable for you by any reason, you may change it in the `server.sh` file.
